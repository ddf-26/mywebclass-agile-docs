## DeVops Plan
1. Planning:
* Define the project scope, objectives, and success criteria.
* Develop user stories and tasks for legal requirements, design, performance, and analytics integration.
* Define the team roles and responsibilities, and allocate resources as needed.
* Use the lean methodology to identify and prioritize the most valuable features that provide the most benefit to users.
2. Development:
* Use Git as the version control system to manage source code and track changes.
* Use agile development practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to ensure that the team is working efficiently and effectively.
* Use a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
3. Testing:
* Use automated testing to ensure that the web template meets quality standards.
* Use a test-driven development (TDD) approach to ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and meets the user's needs.
* Use continuous testing to ensure that the application is tested throughout the development lifecycle.
* Use shift-left testing to ensure that testing is done early in the development process.
4. Deployment:
* Continuously integrate code changes into the shared repository, and trigger automated tests.
* Use blue-green deployment to minimize downtime and ensure that the application is always available.
* Use GitHub Pages as a deployment automation tool.
5. Maintenance:
* Conduct regular maintenance tasks such as upgrading dependencies, fixing bugs, and updating security patches.
* Use monitoring and logging tools to track performance and user behavior, and use the data to make data-driven decisions to improve the application.
* Continuously improve the application based on user feedback and business requirements.
* Use agile methodologies such as sprint planning, retrospectives, and user feedback to continuously improve the application.
